# p2p-chat-og-video
p2p chat og video projekt.

This is NOT my project but rather an example/experiment for myself to show that I could set a simple p2p chat and video website up. SUCCES.
The way it works is that you follow the following steps:
1. Put all files in ONE folder.
2. Locate folder in the terminal/cmd.
3. follow the steps here for installing important stuff: https://codingshiksha.com/javascript/build-p2p-peer-to-peer-video-and-text-chat-in-javascript-using-simple-peer-and-webrtc-full-tutorial/
4. Create a local server ('http-server' in the terminal / cmd)

In the browser you can open up a separate tab with one of the tabs having #init in the end of the "localhost:x" to make it easier to see and work on both.
1. You copy "Your ID" from the tab with #init in the top paste it in the tab without #init in and press the button named connect. (std link or something)
2. After pasting "Your ID" in tab 2(not #init) where it says "Other ID" and press connect, you will get an ID in the tab 2 (Your ID gets updated).
3. Paste the updated "Your ID" in tab 1 (#init) where everything started and press the connect button.
4. Have fun with the chat and video. (If you've allowed the camera then you'll be able to see yourself).
